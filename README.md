# interpreted-executable
an esoteric programming language that uses commands and simulates an executable but that you interpret (I know they use 1's and 0's but when I open the executable file in my vscode, it shows @1 or other things or the user's message string. In this language, it uses @m<number> which in this case are the ways that the interpreter will interpret: @m1 = print a message @m2 = add integers to the stack (yes, this esolang is stack-based) @m3 = adds a string to the stack and the rest the examples.iexe file shows the rest of the features
